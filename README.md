# Advent of Code 2020
This contains all my solutions for Advent of Code 2020.
No particular attempts to optimise have been made, and some of the code is a bit rough. You have been warned.

However, it solves all puzzles on an Intel i5 @ 2.5GHz in ~6 seconds, with day 15 part 2 taking a little over 1s
as the biggest chunk of that.

Puzzle answers have been removed. You can run this with your own inputs by adding files named "advent1.txt" etc... with
the appropriate puzzle inputs. Except for day 25, where the input was hard-coded in.
